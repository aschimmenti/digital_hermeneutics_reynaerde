Firstly, for most Beast Epics we only know approximately where and when they came into being, therefore we do not know for whom they were originally intended. Secondly, the Beast Epic mirrors its social context only indirectly. The protagonists are not humans, but animals who behave like humans. I shall try to demonstrate that it is nevertheless possible to analyse the Beast Epic as testimony of certain mental attitudes and qualities, but that this must be done in an indirect way: by analysing the intertextual relationships of the chosen texts first, and by using the results of that analysis as arguments in a sketch of the social context afterwards. As examples I shall use some branches of the Roman de Renart and the Middle Dutch Beast Epics Van den Vos Reynaerde and Reynaerts Historie.",

[^2] We know these stories from fourteen manuscripts and about ten fragments, each of which contains its own selection from the whole body of stories (Varty 1988: 1-7).\n\nProbably the oldest branch is Branch II. [^3] This is a kind of a little anthology of Renart stories. The first part of the branch tells about encounters between the fox and (i) Chantecler the cockerel, (ii) an anonymous titmouse, (iii) Tibert the tomcat and (iv) Tiecelin the crow. These four adventures probably existed first as single stories, probably orally told, and they were joined by parallel structures and through internal crossreferences, etc.",

He asks Tibert to assist him in his fight with Isengrin the wolf. Tibert swears to serve Renart faithfully, as a vassal should. But Renart has not abandoned his evil intentions. He has seen a trap just before meeting Tibert. Now he suggests a race to pass the time. Tibert agrees. Renart invites Tibert to run as fast as possible in the direction of the trap. Tibert senses the danger and swerves at the last minute. Renart tries a second time, but now Tibert jumps over the trap. Then two hunting dogs arrive and drive both animals again in the direction of the trap. When the fox wants to avoid it, the cat pushes him and throws him into the trap where Renart is eventually mauled by the dogs and attacked by their master, but finally escapes.",

In the French war epics (Chansons de geste) knights often swear to each other faithful assistance. The phrases which the author uses to describe the alliance between Renart and Tibert are very similar to the ones used in the Chansons de geste. But the basis of this alliance is totally different from the one between knights. In the Chansons de geste brothers-in-arms are absolutely faithful to each other. Here both have bad intentions. Renart uses the promise of faithful assistance in order to placate a potentially dangerous enemy, but he nevertheless tries as hard as he can to harm him. Tibert never trusts Renart and tricks him when he has a chance.\n\nThe relationship between Branch II and the Chansons de geste is emphasised by the use of metaphorical language.

It opens with a description of Tiecelin's taking of a cheese from an old woman. This description resembles that of a knight going into battle and making a prisoner - another allusion to the literature of chivalry. The crow holds the cheese between a branch of a tree and one of his claws and feeds from it. Small pieces of cheese fall onto Renart who is lying under the tree. Renart flatters Tiecelin and begs him to sing. He urges him on to exert himself until the crow drops the cheese. But now, different from the fable, the story continues. Renart does not take the cheese. He even complains that its bad smell is making him feel ill. He has a bad wound (from the Tibert adventure), and as everybody knows, a strong smell is bad for wounds. 'Please Tiecelin, take it away. I would do it myself if I were not so weak.' Tiecelin believes the flatterer and flies down from the tree.

As already mentioned, it is a variant of (even in the Middle Ages) a very well-known fable. The audience is expecting the usual ending: the fox gets the cheese. It looks as if this expectation is not to be fulfilled, but then, at the end, it is. Furthermore, this story is a variant of the first story in Branch II, the meeting between Chantecler and Renart (lines 23-463). Chantecler is also tricked through flattery. Here Renart manages to seize him, but during the fox's return home Chantecler uses a similar trick against Renart, and the cock escapes. Renart has troubled himself for nothing. Here Tiecelin escapes as well, but Renart at least keeps the cheese. In this way we are offered variations on the theme of trickery.

The reason for this hostility is the adultery between the fox and the she-wolf. This topic is introduced in the second part of Branch II (lines 1,025-1,396; Owen 1994: 67-72). Here we find two scenes centred on the fox and the she-wolf. In the first scene the fox gets inadvertently into the wolf's den. He is afraid of the she-wolf who makes fun of him and asks why he had not visited her sooner. He answers that he did not dare to because the wolf was telling all and sundry that he, the fox, had an eye on his wife and that he intended to beat him up for it. The she-wolf gets angry. If she is being accused, they might as well take advantage of the situation, so she invites the fox for a romp. This is without doubt adultery. A few days later the she-wolf and the wolf meet the fox, and chase him. The she-wolf is faster than the wolf. The fox dashes into his den. The she-wolf tries to follow, but is too big for the entrance, and gets stuck. The fox emerges from his den by another exit and rapes the she-wolf before the very eyes of the wolf just as he arrives on the scene.",

This part-serious, part-comic matter is again and again treated, most often in the form of a trial (Varty 1984; Varty 1986).\n\nTwo of these trials are important in my argument: the one in Branch Va which is thought to have originally belonged to Branch II, and the one in Branch I, the most famous and the most popular branch. In both trials the action follows fairly accurately the procedure of trials in France at that time.

In Branch Va the trial resembles that of a cour d'amour and one finds casuistry much as in questions about courtly love. For instance, the king answers the question of what exactly has to be judged in the following way: 'whether he who is smitten by love should be found guilty of the act which has brought contempt on his companion' (lines 501-04; Owen 1994: 95). And he says to the wolf: 'that Reynard loved her [= the she-wolf] mitigates his sin to some extent, since he deceived out of love.

Isolda has to submit to divine judgement, because she has been accused of adultery with Tristan, the nephew of her husband, King Mark. The accusation is well founded. In order to reach the place of judgement, Isolda must cross a small stream. Tristan, disguised as a beggar, is waiting there. She\n\nasks him to carry her across so that she does not get wet. He does this, but intentionally stumbles when he reaches the other shore, and falls on top of Isolda. Everybody witnesses this small accident.

But only two people know this, the two lovers. In Branch I there is also a play with the wording of the oath. When Hersent the she-wolf defends herself, she uses the following phrases: 'Reynard never did anything to me he wouldn't have done to his mother' (lines 149-50; Owen 1994: 7). And: 'never have I personally indulged in any more lechery, wickedness, or wantonness than a nun might commit' (lines 176-9; Owen 1994: 7). Here also the words are ambiguous. They are meant to underline Hersent's innocence but because there is no guarantee at all that Renart has treated his mother only honourably and because every nun is able to be lecherous, wanton or wicked (although she should not be), their effect on the public is contrary.

We have mentioned already that the legal procedures in Branches Va and I are similar to a cour d'amour. These similarities have been omitted in Van den Vos Reynaerde. On the other hand, some details, reflecting the actual legal practice of the thirteenth century, have been added. These additions are mainly in the first part of the narrative. The effect is that the complaints against the fox are treated more fully than in the French source, in particular the hearing of witnesses; hearing that inevitably leads to legal proceedings against the fox. A second effect of this alteration is that the relation between the king and his barons (i.e., his advisers) is much more important. At every legal step the king asks for the advice of his barons and follows it. In Branch I the king decides that Renart be summoned to court and he chooses the three messagers to carry the summons. In Van den Vos Reynaerde all this happens following the advice of the barons. The feudal bond between a lord and his vassals is emphasised. This feudal harmony, however, gets threatened in the course of the narrative. When Reynaert talks about the treasure, the narrator says: 'The king and the queen, both hoping for gain, took Reynaert apart for consultation' (lines",

The author uses here the expression te rade (in consultation) to describe the discussion between king, queen and Reynaert. Previously, the author used this expression only when the king was holding counsel with his barons.

In this way it resembles the Roman de Renart. But in the Roman de Renart many of these allusions are implied; the audience must work out the link for itself. In Reynaerts Historie, allusions to another text are always fully explained. Thus we find references to important authors or texts, for instance: 'Seneca speaks to us: \"a lord must everywhere do full justice\"' (lines 4,757-58), or 'Mark what is written in the Gospel: estote misericordes, i.e. be merciful. And it also says: nolite iudicare et non iudicabimini, i.e. Judge not, lest ye be judged' (lines 4,777-84). We find here an accurate quotation from Luke 6: 36-37, in Latin and in the vernacular.

The quoting of authorities and the summarising of other texts is not done by the author but by protagonists in the narrative. They quote with ulterior motives. The authorities that I mentioned and the story of the adulterous woman are used by the she-ape Rukenau, an aunt of Reynaert, when she defends him before the king. She uses several arguments, one of them being that no one is without sin, and that this should be the reason for negating the mistakes made by others (i.e. Reynaert), or for forgiving them. Morally this is a praiseworthy attitude in private life, but as a part of a legal investigation, as it is here, it is of questionable validity. Whoever adopts this attitude wholeheartedly must abolish all penal jurisdiction. That is not Rukenau's intention. All she wants to achieve is lenient treatment for her nephew, if not an acquittal. Reynaert himself tells the story of the judgement of Paris and the adventure of the flying horse from Cleomades. The context is as follows: the king accuses him of having sent him a bag containing the head of Kuwaert the hare. The king assumes (and rightly so) that Reynaert has killed Kuwaert. Reynaert says, however, that he did indeed send a bag to the king, but that it contained three jewels: a ring, a comb and a mirror. That is a lie. To make it convincing he describes the jewels in minute detail. Surely only someone who has owned these things could describe them in such detail. Reynaert says that the judgement of Paris was depicted as decoration on the comb. The wood of the mirror frame, so says Reynaert, was similar to the wood of which the flying horse was made on which Cleomades rode during some of his adventures. Reynaert then gives a short version of these adventures. He uses these stories to impress the animals at court. The audience of Reynaerts Historie was expected to detect Reynaert's intention.",

References like the one to the Tristan story in Branches II and Va can only be meaningful to an audience that is well acquainted with these stories (Regalado 1976). It is generally assumed that the Tristan story was meant for an aristocratic audience. Therefore the same must be the case for the Renart stories. This makes sense to me. I believe an examination of the manuscripts, even if they do not represent the oldest form of the story of the Roman de Renart, would provide additional arguments for this hypothesis.

(Van Oostrom 1992: esp. ch. 3). This stylisation of life can take various forms, but all of them are the result of a mentality that aims to impose beauty, luxury and pleasure on to the ordinary reality of life. Courtly literature is a part of this courtly lifestyle (country bumpkins cannot appreciate it). It is the mirror of courtly life (its heroes give good examples; they represent the ideal of the world of chivalry). And sometimes it even questions the courtly ideal. This questioning can take different forms. One can think of texts which mock, but there is no need to go so far. In the vast corpus of the prose Lancelot texts, it is remarkable that even the greatest heroes offend sometimes (slightly) against courtly etiquette.

They relate to classical courtly texts and they play with them. Traditional formulas, scenes and events of courtly literature are now represented by animals. These scenes and events are thus rendered ironically. That is not to say that the Roman de Renart is void of serious intentions. If extra-marital courtly love is represented as animal-lust, if the bond between knights is depicted as a means to betray a brother-in-arms, or if knightly bravery is depicted as a means to pursue egotistical aims, then this points to criticism of some aspects of the courtly life. And it was, of course, unavoidable that real life in the France of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries would seem to be wanting when compared with the courtly ideal. The texts of the Roman de Renart show an awareness of this, and in that sense they are perfectly serious. But this serious attention is surrounded by an astonishing amount of playful elements. The frequency of allusions to literary sources is much greater than the frequency with which their moral or social content is questioned (Scheidegger 1989). If we look at the Roman de Renart as a whole, we are surprised by the nature and quality of the in-breeding in the later branches. These are hardly more than variants of earlier themes, and their character as variants nearly always dominates all possible moral criticism. To sum up, we can say that the playful elements are very much in the foreground. In this way the Roman de Renart resembles numerous other literary texts in the same social context.",

There is a lot of evidence that the high Flemish aristocracy used French as a common language. For whom then were all the texts written in Flemish?

The patricians used French in commerce and dealings with the court of the Flemish counts, but in daily life, amongst themselves, they spoke Flemish. If this hypothesis is correct we have here a very cultured audience, but one that took considerably less part in the life at court than did the audience of the Roman de Renart. The observations I made in connection with Van den Vos Reynaerde fit well into this hypothesis. The text presupposes much less literary knowledge than the Roman de Renart, and is much less playful. (This does not mean that the text is not funny; in fact it is often very funny, but the comical elements do not need comparisons with other literary texts.) On the other hand, the text has more educational and moralising tendencies. In this regard there is a link between Van den Vos Reynaerde and Lantsloot vander Haghedochte (Van Oostrom 1981; Janssens 1994). The latter is a Flemish adaptation of the French prose Lancelot. Surprisingly, this Flemish text is in verse, so it does not follow the innovatory prose form of its source. It is also noticeable that in the Flemish version the courtly character of the action is very much emphasised. What is implicit in the source becomes explicit in the reworking; small deviations from the norm are systematically retouched. This is explained by pointing out that the audience of the Lancelot was so well acquainted with the rules of courtly life that the author was free to let his characters behave naturally, whereas the audience of the Lansloot was much less knowledgeable about the rules of courtly life and needed more precise examples and explanations about courtly rules and ideals. In Van den Vos Reynaerde we find a similar phenomenon. The text is not so much concerned with a greater idealisation but with the wish to explain, clarify, and develop the conflict found in its source.",

The so-called Yale manuscript of the prose Lancelot was probably in the possession of one of the sons of Gwide of Dampierre. In this manuscript there is a marginal drawing (on fol. 133v; see figure 4.1) depicting a fox which is holding a hare between its forepaws (Bouwman 1991a: 52-53). The hare has a book in its hand. This picture refers most probably to a scene from Van den Vos Reynaerde in which the fox wants to teach the hare to read the Credo, and in which this particular posture is described. This scene does not exist in any French Renart text. The same picture is also in two Latin Psalters of which one probably belonged to Gwide of Dampierre himself (see figure 4.2).

Paradoxically, the social conditions reflected in the text can be quite clearly described. We see in the whole of Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries that the structure of feudalism is being replaced by the gradual forming of nations and that this development is accompanied by the increasingly powerful and ever-growing class of administrators (Murray 1978). These administrators were recruited from intellectual circles, men who had either studied law or the arts. At the same time a money market develops: a considerable part of this money is handled at some time or another by these administrators. This development was not gladly received by everybody.

I have already mentioned that the audience had to discover for themselves the misuse of knowledge by the story's protagonists. The question whether this knowledge itself was expected from the audience remains open. It is not necessarily so. The audience can follow the story and understand the message in the epilogue without having the same information that the protagonists have. But the protagonist's knowledge has noteworthy peculiarities. When Reynaert speaks about the judgement of Paris he describes it as an unusually positive event. This is particularly remarkable because all other medieval descriptions of this judgement known to me are decidedly negative. Either it is described as the starting point of the Trojan war which led to the destruction of the first city ever known, or it is pointed out that Paris opted for a life of lasciviousness instead of reason and contemplation. Hence there is something suspicious about Reynaert's knowledge, just as there is about the use he makes of it (Wackers 1986: 199-202). I believe this suggests that the audience understood this and was therefore sufficiently learned to do so. This means the text functioned within the √©lite, that it was intended for people who experienced in reality the problems described in the text's fictional world.

      "content": "# Medieval French and Dutch Renardian Epics: Between Literature and Society \n\nPaul Wackers\n\nNowadays among scholars the opinion is generally accepted that medieval literary texts can be read as witnesses for the social conditions in which they were written. ${ }^{1}$ This then should also be the case for the Beast Epic, but trying to read texts from this corpus in this way raises difficulties. Firstly, for most Beast Epics we only know approximately where and when they came into being, therefore we do not know for whom they were originally intended. Secondly, the Beast Epic mirrors its social context only indirectly. The protagonists are not humans, but animals who behave like humans. I shall try to demonstrate that it is nevertheless possible to analyse the Beast Epic as testimony of certain mental attitudes and qualities, but that this must be done in an indirect way: by analysing the intertextual relationships of the chosen texts first, and by using the results of that analysis as arguments in a sketch of the social context afterwards. As examples I shall use some branches of the Roman de Renart and the Middle Dutch Beast Epics Van den Vos Reynaerde and Reynaerts Historie.\n\nThe Roman de Renart consists of a number of short to mid-dle-length stories which tell of the fox Renart and his adventures with individual animals, but mainly about his quarrels with the court of the king, the lion Noble. [^2] We know these stories from fourteen manuscripts and about ten fragments, each of which contains its own selection from the whole body of stories (Varty 1988: 1-7).\n\nProbably the oldest branch is Branch II. [^3] This is a kind of a little anthology of Renart stories. The first part of the branch tells about encounters between the fox and (i) Chantecler the cockerel, (ii) an anonymous titmouse, (iii) Tibert the tomcat and (iv) Tiecelin the crow. These four adventures probably existed first as single stories, probably orally told, and they were joined by parallel structures and through internal crossreferences, etc.\n\nLet us first consider the last two adventures (lines 654-842 and $843-1,026$ ). [^4] When Renart meets Tibert he is in a very grumbly mood, for he has not eaten all day. But he does not dare to challenge the cat because Tibert is strong and well armed with teeth and claws. He asks Tibert to assist him in his fight with Isengrin the wolf. Tibert swears to serve Renart faithfully, as a vassal should. But Renart has not abandoned his evil intentions. He has seen a trap just before meeting Tibert. Now he suggests a race to pass the time. Tibert agrees. Renart invites Tibert to run as fast as possible in the direction of the trap. Tibert senses the danger and swerves at the last minute. Renart tries a second time, but now Tibert jumps over the trap. Then two hunting dogs arrive and drive both animals again in the direction of the trap. When the fox wants to avoid it, the cat pushes him and throws him into the trap where Renart is eventually mauled by the dogs and attacked by their master, but finally escapes.\n\nThe author makes this a comical story by exploiting the chivalrous concept of comradeship between knights. In the French war epics (Chansons de geste) knights often swear to each other faithful assistance. The phrases which the author uses to describe the alliance between Renart and Tibert are very similar to the ones used in the Chansons de geste. But the basis of this alliance is totally different from the one between knights. In the Chansons de geste brothers-in-arms are absolutely faithful to each other. Here both have bad intentions. Renart uses the promise of faithful assistance in order to placate a potentially dangerous enemy, but he nevertheless tries as hard as he can to harm him. Tibert never trusts Renart and tricks him when he has a chance.\n\nThe relationship between Branch II and the Chansons de geste is emphasised by the use of metaphorical language. The race between the two animals is described like a horse-race.\n\nThere are moments when one cannot tell whether the narrative is about a racing animal or a knight on horseback. In the description of this race the author uses again vocabulary from the Chansons de geste.\n\nSo we have here a parody of certain elements found in serious literature. There are two possible causes for this. Either the author of Branch II wants to criticise a particular aspect of chivalry, or he wants to make fun of the concept of the bond between knights in literature as a whole. Scholars do not agree as to which of these two possibilities is the more likely one.\n\nThe fourth adventure, Renart and Tiecelin, is a variant of the well-known fable of the Fox and the Crow. It opens with a description of Tiecelin's taking of a cheese from an old woman. This description resembles that of a knight going into battle and making a prisoner - another allusion to the literature of chivalry. The crow holds the cheese between a branch of a tree and one of his claws and feeds from it. Small pieces of cheese fall onto Renart who is lying under the tree. Renart flatters Tiecelin and begs him to sing. He urges him on to exert himself until the crow drops the cheese. But now, different from the fable, the story continues. Renart does not take the cheese. He even complains that its bad smell is making him feel ill. He has a bad wound (from the Tibert adventure), and as everybody knows, a strong smell is bad for wounds. 'Please Tiecelin, take it away. I would do it myself if I were not so weak.' Tiecelin believes the flatterer and flies down from the tree. Renart jumps at him but gets only four feathers, and Tiecelin escapes. Renart keeps only the cheese.\n\nBesides the links with the literature of chivalry, this 'fable' mainly alludes to other animal stories. As already mentioned, it is a variant of (even in the Middle Ages) a very well-known fable. The audience is expecting the usual ending: the fox gets the cheese. It looks as if this expectation is not to be fulfilled, but then, at the end, it is. Furthermore, this story is a variant of the first story in Branch II, the meeting between Chantecler and Renart (lines 23-463). Chantecler is also tricked through flattery. Here Renart manages to seize him, but during the fox's return home Chantecler uses a similar trick against Renart, and the cock escapes. Renart has troubled himself for nothing. Here Tiecelin escapes as well, but Renart at least keeps the cheese. In this way we are offered variations on the theme of trickery. One could even say that all four stories of the first part are variations on this theme, but to demonstrate that would lead too far from my main argument.\n\nThese variations on and allusions to other literature show that Branch II is meant to be compared with other texts. In fact we find allusions to other literary genres and topics right at its beginning. In the prologue we read:\n\nMy lords, you have heard many a tale from many a story-teller: how Paris carried off Helen to his great trouble and woe, La Ch√®vre's splendid story of Tristan, various fabliaux and chansons de geste; and many another goes around the country telling the romance of Yvain and his beast. But you have never heard of the great, grim war between Reynard and Isengrin that they waged so long and bitterly. The fact is that there was never any love lost between these two lords; but to tell you the truth, they often engaged in fights and brawls... (lines 1-17; Owen 1994: 53)\n\nThis prologue is difficult to interpret. For instance, we do not know whether 'La Ch√®vre' is the name of an author or whether it is saying something about Tristan himself (Lodge 1983). But whatever the problems of interpretation, what matters for my argument is the fact that this prologue places the following Renart adventures in relation to other literary texts; to the Matter of Troy (Paris and Helen), to the Tristan legends, to the Fabliaux, and the Chansons de geste. Right from the beginning, this text is seen to be a reaction to other texts, or their mirror-image. It is important to keep this in mind.\n\nAnother reason to quote this prologue is the fact that it points to the chief topic of the Roman de Renart: the hostility between fox and wolf. The reason for this hostility is the adultery between the fox and the she-wolf. This topic is introduced in the second part of Branch II (lines 1,025-1,396; Owen 1994: 67-72). Here we find two scenes centred on the fox and the she-wolf. In the first scene the fox gets inadvertently into the wolf's den. He is afraid of the she-wolf who makes fun of him and asks why he had not visited her sooner. He answers that he did not dare to because the wolf was telling all and sundry that he, the fox, had an eye on his wife and that he intended to beat him up for it. The she-wolf gets angry. If she is being accused, they might as well take advantage of the situation, so she invites the fox for a romp. This is without doubt adultery. A few days later the she-wolf and the wolf meet the fox, and chase him. The she-wolf is faster than the wolf. The fox dashes into his den. The she-wolf tries to follow, but is too big for the entrance, and gets stuck. The fox emerges from his den by another exit and rapes the she-wolf before the very eyes of the wolf just as he arrives on the scene.\n\nAgain and again these two scenes are alluded to in subsequent branches. The problem is that the wolf can rightly make the accusation that his wife has been raped; but he remains a cuckold. This part-serious, part-comic matter is again and again treated, most often in the form of a trial (Varty 1984; Varty 1986).\n\nTwo of these trials are important in my argument: the one in Branch Va which is thought to have originally belonged to Branch II, and the one in Branch I, the most famous and the most popular branch. In both trials the action follows fairly accurately the procedure of trials in France at that time. But we also find mockery and ironic treatment of legal procedures, especially in Branch Va where a papal legate arrives, a camel from Lombardy. This camel speaks a strange linguistic mixture:\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nWherefore, sire give me audition! By us is found in the Decretal scribed under the rubric published anent violation of marriage, that, primo, by you shall be examined the accused, who, if incapable of exculpation, may suffer punition by you ad libitum, inasmuch as his act was gravely peccable. My verdict is quod sequitur: if he lack volition to render quid pro quo whereby his wherwithal shall in totality suffer public sequestration, then let the said diabolical Reynard undergo lapidation or incineration in persona! Exhibit then your regality nulli secundus: should some party infract or bring into disrepute the law, then let him yield reparation in extremo (lines 457-74; Owen 1994: 95).\n\n\nThe main topic in these two branches lies not in the domain of legal matters, but in the theme of love. In Branch Va the trial resembles that of a cour d'amour and one finds casuistry much as in questions about courtly love. For instance, the king answers the question of what exactly has to be judged in the following way: 'whether he who is smitten by love should be found guilty of the act which has brought contempt on his companion' (lines 501-04; Owen 1994: 95). And he says to the wolf: 'that Reynard loved her [= the she-wolf] mitigates his sin to some extent, since he deceived out of love. He is certainly a noble, distinguished person' (lines 436-9; Owen 1994: 94).\n\nIn Branch I we find a parallel to the trial in the Tristan story. Isolda has to submit to divine judgement, because she has been accused of adultery with Tristan, the nephew of her husband, King Mark. The accusation is well founded. In order to reach the place of judgement, Isolda must cross a small stream. Tristan, disguised as a beggar, is waiting there. She\n\nasks him to carry her across so that she does not get wet. He does this, but intentionally stumbles when he reaches the other shore, and falls on top of Isolda. Everybody witnesses this small accident. When Isolda makes her oath of innocence she says that she has never lain in the arms of another man but her husband's and the beggar's. The divine judgement speaks for her and everyone believes in her innocence.\n\nAt the centre of this story is the wording of the oath. By means of the trick of Tristan's disguise as a beggar, Isolda can swear something that is true and yet does not contradict the rightful accusation, although it seems to do so. But only two people know this, the two lovers. In Branch I there is also a play with the wording of the oath. When Hersent the she-wolf defends herself, she uses the following phrases: 'Reynard never did anything to me he wouldn't have done to his mother' (lines 149-50; Owen 1994: 7). And: 'never have I personally indulged in any more lechery, wickedness, or wantonness than a nun might commit' (lines 176-9; Owen 1994: 7). Here also the words are ambiguous. They are meant to underline Hersent's innocence but because there is no guarantee at all that Renart has treated his mother only honourably and because every nun is able to be lecherous, wanton or wicked (although she should not be), their effect on the public is contrary. In fact they emphasise Hersent's adultery.\n\nI have shown that in these two trials the Roman de Renart hints at other literature, and only indirectly at the social conditions of the time in which it was composed. It is important to state that this kind of literature can only function when the audience is sufficiently knowledgeable about other literary texts to pick up and decode the given signals.\n\nLet us now look at the Beast Epic in the Dutch tradition. In Middle Dutch we have two Reynaert stories. The first, Van den Vos Reynaerde, was written in the middle of the thirteenth century and is a reworking of Branch I with a new ending. ${ }^{5}$ The second, Reynaerts Historie, was written about 1400. ${ }^{6}$ This later version follows Van den Vos Reynaerde very closely but changes the end in order to tell about another confrontation between Reynaert and Nobel's court. Reynaerts Historie is the basis for the later European Reynard tradition (Menke 1992). If you know Goethe's Reineke Fuchs, the Low German Reynke de Vos or Caxton's Reynard the Fox, then you know the story of Reynaerts Historie.\n\nLet us start with the older text, Van den Vos Reynaerde. There we find, as in the Roman de Renart, allusions to other literary\n\ntexts. For instance the big court day at the beginning mirrors the traditional beginning of many Arthurian stories (Van Daele 1994: 281-3). Also, the scene in which the bear Bruun is ill-treated by the villagers contains allusions to battle-scenes in chivalrous romances (Knapp 1982). These allusions, however, are more global than in the Roman de Renart. They do not point to one concrete text but to genres in general. This means the audience does not need such a large and precise literary knowledge to appreciate the fun (Bouwman 1991b; Van Daele 1994).\n\nIn addition to that, the author of Van den Vos Reynaerde tries his best to tell a story that can stand up entirely on its own. It has a much stronger inner coherence than the different branches of the Roman de Renart. This becomes very obvious when one compares Van den Vos Reynaerde with Branch I, of which it is a reworking. Both stories begin with a big assembly at the royal court. Complaints about Renart/Reynaert are laid before the court. These are contradicted, but the dead body of Reynaert's last victim is abundant proof of his wickedness. Three times Renart/Reynaert is summoned to court. He obeys the third summons to face the complaints made against him, and is sentenced to death.\n\nBranch I then tells how Renart was surrounded by the other animals and mistreated. Following an emotional supplication by Grimbert the badger, the king suddenly changes his mind and sends Renart on a pilgrimage (or crusade, the text is ambiguous here) to the Holy Land. No reason is given for this decision. It comes unexpectedly and gives a new direction to the narrative.\n\nIn Van den Vos Reynaerde the story runs quite differently after the death sentence. Reynaert begs to be allowed to make a public confession before his execution. In this confession he mentions a treasure and states that the treasure was to be used to finance a conspiracy against the king. He (Reynaert), so he says, has spoiled the plot by stealing the treasure. The conspirators were partly his relatives, partly his enemies: the bear, the wolf and the tom-cat. The king wants to have the treasure, so he pardons Reynaert. And because of the accusations the king also has Reynaert's enemies arrested and ill-treated. All phases of the story are clearly linked, and one builds upon the other. In this way Van den Vos Reynaerde has much more in common with modern stories than with the branches of the Roman de Renart. Explaining this difference in literary structure, and the aesthetic concept that goes with it, is difficult. Important for my present argument is the fact that the audi-\n\nence did not need any prior literary knowledge to follow the whole story and to appreciate it.\n\nThis is also obvious in the fable of the frogs who want to have a king (vv. 2,299-2,322). As mentioned above, the fourth story of Branch II was a variant of the fable of the fox, the crow and the cheese. This variant is not explicitly pointed out; the prior knowledge of the audience is assumed and played upon. In Van den Vos Reynaerde the fable of the frogs resembles the same fable in the Esopet, the first collection of fables in medieval Dutch literature. [^7] The audience is informed why this fable is being told. Reynaert needs it in his confession to explain why he does not want Bruun the bear to become king instead of Nobel, which is what the conspirators want. Reynaert compares Bruun with the stork, who is the frog's king and who gobbles them up. Who wants such a king? The audience clearly needs no prior knowledge to understand this fable and its application.\n\nThese examples make clear that the author of Van den Vos Reynaerde does not expect any prior knowledge in his audience, and refers to other literature much less than the authors of the branches of the Roman de Renart. [^8] However, this does not mean that he expected no foreknowledge at all. In legal matters, for instance, Van den Vos Reynaerde goes further than its source (Bouwman 1991b: 397-402). We have mentioned already that the legal procedures in Branches Va and I are similar to a cour d'amour. These similarities have been omitted in Van den Vos Reynaerde. On the other hand, some details, reflecting the actual legal practice of the thirteenth century, have been added. These additions are mainly in the first part of the narrative. The effect is that the complaints against the fox are treated more fully than in the French source, in particular the hearing of witnesses; hearing that inevitably leads to legal proceedings against the fox. A second effect of this alteration is that the relation between the king and his barons (i.e., his advisers) is much more important. At every legal step the king asks for the advice of his barons and follows it. In Branch I the king decides that Renart be summoned to court and he chooses the three messagers to carry the summons. In Van den Vos Reynaerde all this happens following the advice of the barons. The feudal bond between a lord and his vassals is emphasised. This feudal harmony, however, gets threatened in the course of the narrative. When Reynaert talks about the treasure, the narrator says: 'The king and the queen, both hoping for gain, took Reynaert apart for consultation' (lines\n\n2,491-93). This is the first time that the king does not act publicly but separately from his court. It is also the first time that he does not allow himself to be advised but acts independently. The author uses here the expression te rade (in consultation) to describe the discussion between king, queen and Reynaert. Previously, the author used this expression only when the king was holding counsel with his barons. From this point onwards the king isolates himself more and more until nothing is left of the harmony between feudal lord and vassal. The two most important ones, bear and wolf, will be arrested and mutilated at the king's command, urged on by Reynaert.\n\nThis shows that the alterations made in the domain of the law were intentional. They strengthen the importance of the feudal bond between lord and vassal in the narrative. Here Van den Vos Reynaerde deviates noticeably from its source. Signals given to the audience in legal matters are always minor details, short informative phrases, the use of fixed formulae, etc. This implies that the audience was well acquainted with legal procedures, otherwise these signals would not have worked.\n\nThe Roman de Renart and Van den Vos Reynaerde differ in the number and kind of literary allusions. How about the other Middle Dutch Reynardian epic? Here the situation is different yet again. Compared with Van den Vos Reynaerde, Reynaerts Historie points frequently to other literary texts. In this way it resembles the Roman de Renart. But in the Roman de Renart many of these allusions are implied; the audience must work out the link for itself. In Reynaerts Historie, allusions to another text are always fully explained. Thus we find references to important authors or texts, for instance: 'Seneca speaks to us: \"a lord must everywhere do full justice\"' (lines 4,757-58), or 'Mark what is written in the Gospel: estote misericordes, i.e. be merciful. And it also says: nolite iudicare et non iudicabimini, i.e. Judge not, lest ye be judged' (lines 4,777-84). We find here an accurate quotation from Luke 6: 36-37, in Latin and in the vernacular. It is used to refer to the highest possible authority. In cases like this the audience is to recognise the authority as such, but that is all. The text itself explains the meaning of the quoted authority.\n\nThe same pattern exists when not just a quotation but a sizeable part of another text is referred to (Wackers 1986: 100-120). Very often in such cases a short summary is given. In this way the story of the adulterous woman is briefly told (John 8: 1-11; lines 4,785-93), also the judgement of Paris with information of prior events and consequences (lines 5,499-5,563); and, finally, a part of Adenet li Roi's Cleomades (lines 5,591-5,627). The material used is very varied: Bible, classical and courtly literature. The fact that all allusions are explained suggests that no prior knowledge was expected from the audience.\n\nThis does not mean that the audience could accept the narrated stories uncritically. The quoting of authorities and the summarising of other texts is not done by the author but by protagonists in the narrative. They quote with ulterior motives. The authorities that I mentioned and the story of the adulterous woman are used by the she-ape Rukenau, an aunt of Reynaert, when she defends him before the king. She uses several arguments, one of them being that no one is without sin, and that this should be the reason for negating the mistakes made by others (i.e. Reynaert), or for forgiving them. Morally this is a praiseworthy attitude in private life, but as a part of a legal investigation, as it is here, it is of questionable validity. Whoever adopts this attitude wholeheartedly must abolish all penal jurisdiction. That is not Rukenau's intention. All she wants to achieve is lenient treatment for her nephew, if not an acquittal. Reynaert himself tells the story of the judgement of Paris and the adventure of the flying horse from Cleomades. The context is as follows: the king accuses him of having sent him a bag containing the head of Kuwaert the hare. The king assumes (and rightly so) that Reynaert has killed Kuwaert. Reynaert says, however, that he did indeed send a bag to the king, but that it contained three jewels: a ring, a comb and a mirror. That is a lie. To make it convincing he describes the jewels in minute detail. Surely only someone who has owned these things could describe them in such detail. Reynaert says that the judgement of Paris was depicted as decoration on the comb. The wood of the mirror frame, so says Reynaert, was similar to the wood of which the flying horse was made on which Cleomades rode during some of his adventures. Reynaert then gives a short version of these adventures. He uses these stories to impress the animals at court. The audience of Reynaerts Historie was expected to detect Reynaert's intention.\n\nThe situation here is completely different from the one in the Roman de Renart. There, the author alluded either directly in his narrative, or via speeches of the animals, to other literary texts. The audience is to recognise the allusion and to interpret it. The author's intention is to achieve a comical and ironical effect. In Reynaerts Historie allusions to other texts are always explained.\n\nThey are given by the animals in the story, and are always accompanied by a moral. This becomes most obvious when Reynaert describes the decoration of the mirror (lines $5,633-5,881$ ). This consists of four illustrated fable situations. Reynaert relates all four and always adds a moral. All four morals aim at actual situations at court. What the audience of Reynaerts Historie must see is that the protagonists misunderstand the offered morals in the way the narrator intended them to. The author's intention is not to allude to other texts but to give meaning to his own story (Wackers 1986: 216-27).\n\nI have shown how, in three different Beast Epics, allusions to other (mostly literary) texts are employed in three different ways. Hence it is clear that Reynaert has to do with literature. But how about his link with society? This becomes relevant when one tries to explain the differences.\n\nMost Roman de Renart research published in the last ten years deals with the intertextuality of one or several stories, or with traces of an oral tradition, or with the way it was presented. Research into the nature of the audience for these texts, or about the social context of the extant manuscripts has hardly been undertaken. What now follows is based on my own observations and hypotheses, using the scanty material available.\n\nIn the most recent investigations about the likely audience for the Roman de Renart, the consensus is that the audience was aristocratic. [^9] This argument is based mostly on the nature of the texts. References like the one to the Tristan story in Branches II and Va can only be meaningful to an audience that is well acquainted with these stories (Regalado 1976). It is generally assumed that the Tristan story was meant for an aristocratic audience. Therefore the same must be the case for the Renart stories. This makes sense to me. I believe an examination of the manuscripts, even if they do not represent the oldest form of the story of the Roman de Renart, would provide additional arguments for this hypothesis. Several manuscripts have numerous miniatures and many of them are valuable and of high quality. But, as I have already pointed out, there is as yet no published research about this aspect of the manuscripts.\n\nThe aristocratic courtly culture is essentially a play-acting culture with which an √©lite aimed to distinguish itself from the ordinary society by way of a consciously stylised lifestyle. (Van Oostrom 1992: esp. ch. 3). This stylisation of life can take various forms, but all of them are the result of a mentality that aims to impose beauty, luxury and pleasure on to the ordinary reality of life. Courtly literature is a part of this courtly lifestyle (country bumpkins cannot appreciate it). It is the mirror of courtly life (its heroes give good examples; they represent the ideal of the world of chivalry). And sometimes it even questions the courtly ideal. This questioning can take different forms. One can think of texts which mock, but there is no need to go so far. In the vast corpus of the prose Lancelot texts, it is remarkable that even the greatest heroes offend sometimes (slightly) against courtly etiquette. That does not make their behaviour at large less exemplary; it only makes them more human.\n\nI think we must see the texts of the Roman de Renart in this perspective. They relate to classical courtly texts and they play with them. Traditional formulas, scenes and events of courtly literature are now represented by animals. These scenes and events are thus rendered ironically. That is not to say that the Roman de Renart is void of serious intentions. If extra-marital courtly love is represented as animal-lust, if the bond between knights is depicted as a means to betray a brother-in-arms, or if knightly bravery is depicted as a means to pursue egotistical aims, then this points to criticism of some aspects of the courtly life. And it was, of course, unavoidable that real life in the France of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries would seem to be wanting when compared with the courtly ideal. The texts of the Roman de Renart show an awareness of this, and in that sense they are perfectly serious. But this serious attention is surrounded by an astonishing amount of playful elements. The frequency of allusions to literary sources is much greater than the frequency with which their moral or social content is questioned (Scheidegger 1989). If we look at the Roman de Renart as a whole, we are surprised by the nature and quality of the in-breeding in the later branches. These are hardly more than variants of earlier themes, and their character as variants nearly always dominates all possible moral criticism. To sum up, we can say that the playful elements are very much in the foreground. In this way the Roman de Renart resembles numerous other literary texts in the same social context.\n\nThere is little certainty as to the social context of Van den Vos Reynaerde.[^10] A considerable amount of research has been dedicated to questions of origin and reception, but reliable evidence is lacking. All researchers agree that the text was composed in Flanders, and of late most researchers date it in the middle of the thirteenth century. At this time, and more-\n\nover during the whole of the thirteenth century, the court of the Flemish counts played an important role as a centre for French literature. For example: Chr√©tien de Troyes begins his Perceval following a commission from Philip of Alsace; Gwide of Dampierre employs Adenet li Roi (mentioned above); and the Couronnement de Renart, a later French Renart text, was written in memory of William of Dampierre. There is a lot of evidence that the high Flemish aristocracy used French as a common language. For whom then were all the texts written in Flemish? Van den Vos Reynaerde was by no means the only Flemish text from this century (Besamusca 1991; Janssens 1992; Janssens 1994).\n\nMost often it is assumed that the audience for these texts was composed of the patricians who lived in Flemish towns which, in the thirteenth century, were (because of an economic boom) already a considerable political power. The patricians used French in commerce and dealings with the court of the Flemish counts, but in daily life, amongst themselves, they spoke Flemish. If this hypothesis is correct we have here a very cultured audience, but one that took considerably less part in the life at court than did the audience of the Roman de Renart. The observations I made in connection with Van den Vos Reynaerde fit well into this hypothesis. The text presupposes much less literary knowledge than the Roman de Renart, and is much less playful. (This does not mean that the text is not funny; in fact it is often very funny, but the comical elements do not need comparisons with other literary texts.) On the other hand, the text has more educational and moralising tendencies. In this regard there is a link between Van den Vos Reynaerde and Lantsloot vander Haghedochte (Van Oostrom 1981; Janssens 1994). The latter is a Flemish adaptation of the French prose Lancelot. Surprisingly, this Flemish text is in verse, so it does not follow the innovatory prose form of its source. It is also noticeable that in the Flemish version the courtly character of the action is very much emphasised. What is implicit in the source becomes explicit in the reworking; small deviations from the norm are systematically retouched. This is explained by pointing out that the audience of the Lancelot was so well acquainted with the rules of courtly life that the author was free to let his characters behave naturally, whereas the audience of the Lansloot was much less knowledgeable about the rules of courtly life and needed more precise examples and explanations about courtly rules and ideals. In Van den Vos Reynaerde we find a similar phenomenon. The text is not so much concerned with a greater idealisation but with the wish to explain, clarify, and develop the conflict found in its source.\n\nSo far the model I have presented seems convincing, but it is not without problems. How did the patricians come by their French sources? Did they have to borrow them from their aristocratic acquaintances? Or did they fetch them from France and if so, from whom? And why did they commission the creation of Flemish adaptations if they understood French? An imitation of the way of life at court could have been done as well while using French.\n\nAnd there are some indications that there might have been some interest in Flemish texts in the circles around the count after all. We know that some scribes at court wrote in French but also in Flemish. Some of these latter manuscripts have been preserved. There are also more specific literary indications. The so-called Yale manuscript of the prose Lancelot was probably in the possession of one of the sons of Gwide of Dampierre. In this manuscript there is a marginal drawing (on fol. 133v; see figure 4.1) depicting a fox which is holding a hare between its forepaws (Bouwman 1991a: 52-53). The hare has a book in its hand. This picture refers most probably to a scene from Van den Vos Reynaerde in which the fox wants to teach the hare to read the Credo, and in which this particular posture is described. This scene does not exist in any French Renart text. The same picture is also in two Latin Psalters of which one probably belonged to Gwide of Dampierre himself (see figure 4.2). This suggests that the court of the Counts of Flanders probably knew the Flemish Reynaert story.\n\nAlso the emphasis on the topic of feudalism in Van den Vos Reynaerde as compared with its source could point in the same direction. During the thirteenth century the relation between the French king and his vassals deteriorated continually. The way the relation between Nobel and his vassals is treated in Van den Vos Reynaerde could reflect this state of affairs. The very ambiguous reconciliation between Nobel and his vassals at the end of the story seems to me to be especially meaningful in this connection. This scene has never been satisfactorily interpreted (Van Daele 1996).\n\nGenerally speaking, the encouragement of literature in the vernacular could have been a way of stimulating national feeling. The dukes of Brabant certainly worked consciously towards that end during the fourteenth century. Much more research is needed about the relation between French and Dutch literature in Flanders in the thirteenth century if one\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4.1 Reynaert teaching Kuwaert the hare the Creed.

Marginal illustration in a Latin psalter, probably owned by Gwide of Dampierre, Brussels, Royal Library, 10607, f. 86r. (Randall, 1966, fig. 194). wants to have precise ideas about the link between the contents of Van den Vos Reynaerde and the political problems of the counts. More research is also necessary on the possible role of the counts as patrons of Flemish literature. These thoughts are therefore only suggestions. But they show, in any event, that the social context of Van den Vos Reynaerde is different from that of the Roman de Renart.\n\nWith Reynaerts Historie the situation is again quite different. There are hardly any points at which one could link the text to a specific social context. For the time being any dating other than about 1400 is impossible and, although there is an acrostic in the text referring to the Flemish town Diksmuide, the meaning of this reference is as yet unclear (Berteloot 1988; Berteloot 1993). Paradoxically, the social conditions reflected in the text can be quite clearly described. We see in the whole of Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries that the structure of feudalism is being replaced by the gradual forming of nations and that this development is accompanied by the increasingly powerful and ever-growing class of administrators (Murray 1978). These administrators were recruited from intellectual circles, men who had either studied law or the arts. At the same time a money market develops: a considerable part of this money is handled at some time or another by these administrators. This development was not gladly received by everybody. There were numerous complaints about bad advisers of princes who did not work for the honour of their master but rather for their own advantage. Reynaerts Historie fits exactly into this context (Wackers 1986: 73-86).\n\nWe have already shown that the protagonists in Reynaerts Historie misuse their erudition. They use their knowledge for their own advantage. The text as a whole shows this even better. Furthermore, the author himself puts this into words in the epilogue as part of the message of his text. This makes it evident that there is a connection between the social development that is taking place all over Europe and the contents of Reynaerts Historie.\n\nThis does not help us to arrive at a clear view of the original audience of Reynaerts Historie. This view is further obscured because we do not know what the author expects from his audience. I have already mentioned that the audience had to discover for themselves the misuse of knowledge by the story's protagonists. The question whether this knowledge itself was expected from the audience remains open. It is not necessarily so. The audience can follow the story and understand the message in the epilogue without having the same information that the protagonists have. But the protagonist's knowledge has noteworthy peculiarities. When Reynaert speaks about the judgement of Paris he describes it as an unusually positive event. This is particularly remarkable because all other medieval descriptions of this judgement known to me are decidedly negative. Either it is described as the starting point of the Trojan war which led to the destruction of the first city ever known, or it is pointed out that Paris opted for a life of lasciviousness instead of reason and contemplation. Hence there is something suspicious about Reynaert's knowledge, just as there is about the use he makes of it (Wackers 1986: 199-202). I believe this suggests that the audience understood this and was therefore sufficiently learned to do so. This means the text functioned within the √©lite, that it was intended for people who experienced in reality the problems described in the text's fictional world. However, we do not have to exclude a much less knowledgeable audience. In this case one would think of people who had to do with government and administration. For them the story would contain the criticism of an outsider of the goings-on in the centres of power.\n\nI have tried to show with three examples that it is possible to reconstruct at least approximately the social context of animal stories by means of studying their literary context. In the cases of the Roman de Renart and Reynaerts Historie this was obvious; in Van den Vos Reynaerde perhaps less so. But there most of my comments are based on comparisons of Van den Vos Reynaerde and its source, Branch I of the Roman de Renart, so in this case too Reynaert stands halfway between literature and society. I realise that all this contains many uncertainties and hypotheses, but I hope to have demonstrated that the old Dutch proverb 'Two see more than one' has to be altered for a medievalist into 'In two (texts) one sees more than in one' (Van Oostrom 1984a: 30).",
