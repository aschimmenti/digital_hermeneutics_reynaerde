No doubt the Chanson de Roland would figure prominently, as would the Arthurian romances by Chrétien de Troyes. In all probability Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival and Got fried von Strassburg’s Tristan would also be listed. In addition, Dutch readers of the TLS would be certain to make a case for Van den vos Reynaerde (literally: ‘Of Reynaert the Fox’). This Middle Dutch beast epic is famous among specialists, but is hardly known outside the Netherlands and Belgium as a result of the language barrier.",

This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between the oral transmission of tales and written, literary culture or the extent to which the two traditions are rooted in popular and (Latin) scholarly cultures.

This type of poetry was initially regarded by Jacob Grimm as an animal saga, already known by the Germanic tribes, which had developed independently from the classical fables. Later, Leopold Sudre was an exponent of the idea that orally disseminated medieval folk tales featuring animals were based in part on classical fables and Latin monastic poetry. The ‘Aesopists’, on the other hand, detected the direct examples of the Latin and vernacular beast epics from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in these early medieval written animal stories [^2].",

The author of the Ysengrimus, too, creatively recycled a considerable amount of material from classical fables, so that the supposed dependence on folk tales is doubtful, to say the least[^3]. Although the last word has not yet been said (or written) about the early history of the Roman de Renart and the Ysengrimus, these narratives are clearly essential to a proper understanding of the tradition of which Van den vos Reynaerde forms part. The author of this Middle Dutch beast epic, ‘Willem’, was familiar with at least part of the Old French corpus of texts and used it in the course of his composition. The Flemish poet was by no means exceptional in this. Nearly all medieval beast literature, both in Latin and in the vernacular, made creative use of existing texts.",

The lion roared at him, but the fox asked for permission to say something in his de fence and said: ‘Which of all your visitors has done as much for you as I have?

The most significant one is that King Lion’s illness was gradually replaced by the proclamation of a court day as the reason for the animals to gather [^5]. In the course of the Middle Ages this motif was developed in ever more voluminous writings. In the Middle Latin Ysengrimus, written just before 1150 in Ghent, the court day episode numbers some twelve hundred lines (book III), the Old French Le Plaid (‘The Trial’) has just under seventeen hundred, Van den vos Reynaerde has double that amount, and in Reynaerts historie (‘The History of Reynaert’), the fifteenth-century Middle Dutch adaptation and continuation of Van den vos Reynaerde, this number is doubled again. From the Ysengrimus onwards the animals in the stories are not only the characteristic representatives of their kind, but also individuals. They are given fixed proper names: the wolf is called Ysengrimus, Ysengrin, Ysingrijn, the fox Reinardus, Renart, Reynaert. In addition situations and customs from the contemporary, real world are interpolated and sometimes satirized. It will not be accidental that the monk who wrote the Middle Latin Ysengrimus for a monastic audience, regularly presents the greedy wolf as an abbot and bishop. In Le Plaid and Van den vos Reynaerde the setting is that of a feudal, chivalric society: the wolf and the fox have become barons.",

They have as their subject matter the conflicts between the fox Renart and his arch-enemy Ysengrin the wolf and the other animals in King Noble’s realm. The oldest surviving story was probably written about 1175 by Pierre de Saint Cloud (referred to as ‘Perrot’; see p. 15) and relates the origin of the feud: the adultery between Renart and Ysengrin’s wife Hersent, and later Renart’s rape of Hersent,  which led to legal proceedings at the court of King Noble [^6]. This story must have been instantly successful, for between 1175 and 1180 six other narratives about Renart were written by different authors, up to 1205 there were another eleven, and even in the first half of the thirteenth century several more appeared. These Renart branches at first functioned independently (even though they responded to one another), but soon they were collected in compilations. Fourteen complete manuscript compilations are  extant, as well as nineteen fragments and manuscripts containing one or more branches, dating mainly from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Research into the Roman de Renart was long aimed at reconstruction: of the sources, or of the original texts, and of the Ur-compilation on which the compilation codices are based [^7] In the past few decades more at ention has been paid to the diversity of the literary and manuscript forms of the extant branches.[^8]",

      "text": "It is not surprising that, when writing Van den vos Reynaerde, it was this branch I that Willem took as an example. From a literary point of view Le Plaid is one of the most attractive stories of the Roman de Renart, and, probably for that reason, the one surviving in the largest number of manuscripts. The story was also rewritten repeatedly by Old French poets. In Le duel judiciaire (branch VI) the fox stands trial once again for his crimes. This time this results in a judicial duel with Ysengrin, which Renart loses. In Renart médecin (branch X) the fox is summoned by orders of the king, at first by the dog Roonel, later by Brichemer the stag, but in both cases the mission fails through Renart’s doing. Not until Renart hears that Noble has fallen ill does he travel to the king’s court with Grinbert. There he poses as a doctor and of course knows exactly how the king can be cured: by making him sweat heavily in Ysengrin’s skin. It is some times difficult to see whether the author has conceived of a new story or presents a new version of an existing story. In two Roman de Renart manuscripts (B and H) Le Plaid contains a passage of approximately a hundred and thirty lines in which Renart’s conviction and reconciliation with the king has been completely rewritten. This version particularly distinguishes itself by the detailed account of the barons’ consultation that precedes the death sentence and by the role played by Grinbert, here presented as his nephew’s saviour [^10]",

This means that, when plots are compared, the suspense factor in these stories no longer lies in the question if the fox will manage to keep out of the clutches of the king and his courtiers, but rather how that is achieved. This applies to us, the modern readers, and must also have been true for Willem’s audience, in so far as it was familiar with other animal stories (see pp. 31-33). In comparison with Le Plaid and the other branches set during a court day, Van den vos Reynaerde distinguishes itself in particular by the superior manner of the Flemish fox’s escape from execution. In Le Plaid, King Noble takes pity on the fox and pardons him, which may be generous, but is hardly convincing from a psychological point of view. In Willem’s poem the fox plays on Nobel’s greed by weaving a brilliant concoction of lies. He misleads the king with the story of his unhappy childhood and by casually mentioning a treasure and a conspiracy to kill King Nobel. Even Reynaert’s own relatives are said to have been involved in that plot. Next he gives a detailed description of the place where the treasure is to be found, which is confirmed by Cuwaert the hare, capping the deception by the tale of his excommunication which will enable him to flee the court as a pilgrim. A mere promise of profit – and nothing more substantial – is sufficient ground for Nobel to be reconciled with Reynaert. The French king may have been sentimental, the Flemish king proves to be immoral. This is also the reason why the reputation of the court is tarnished far worse at the end of Willem’s poem than it is in Le Plaid.",

In this cleverly compiled Latin poem of more than 6,500 lines, divided into seven books, the greedy wolf takes centre stage. The best supporting role for a male character is for the fox, his enemy and evil counsellor. Their confrontations are primarily verbal in character, with Reinardus’ illusory reality dominating that of the wolf. As a result Ysengrimus allows himself to be manipulated and, back in the real world, is severely punished for his credulity. He is repeatedly seriously wounded, is flayed to cure the sick king and is eventually torn apart by a herd of wild pigs [^12].\n\n}",

In both categories animals are described not for their own sake, but to transmit a deeper meaning. Whereas in the beast epic the animals are authorial creations, meant to provide a moralising representation of human life, animals in Latin bestiaries or ‘books of beasts’ are seen as natural phenomena, in accordance with the medieval view that the created, transitory world refers to God’s real, eternal world [^14]. The outer characteristics and behaviour of the animals is interpreted allegorically. In this way they provide medieval mankind with lessons about God and the devil, about heaven and hell, about virtue and sin. In works on natural history – as in De naturis rerum by Thomas of Cantimpré, translated and adapted by the thirteenth-century Flemish author Jacob van Maerlant in his Der naturen bloeme – there is more emphasis on zoological knowledge. Information of this kind was not usually, however, the result of personal observation, but was derived from such authorities as the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC), who in the Middle Ages was seen as the greatest scholar of all time, Pliny (23/24-79), the Roman military commander, procurator and writer, and the archbishop and encyclopedist Isidore of Seville (ca.565-636) [^15].",

There have been several attempts at narrowing down this broad estimate with its margin of one hundred years by reading the poem to a greater or lesser degree as a roman à clef. Maurits Gysseling discerned allusions to historical events from the last years of the reign of Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders (1168-1191), on the basis of which he dates the work before 1191. Leopold Peeters, on the other hand, wanted to assign a date of around 1260, as several passages were considered by him to refer to the struggle between two noble dynasties, the Dampierre and the Avesnes families, about the succession in Flanders and Hainault [^23].\tA certain consensus has formed around the latter date, although on different grounds. It appears that Willem made use of an Old French compilation, the original version of which is dated after 1205. Aspects of his versification technique have also led to a date of around or just after the middle of the thirteenth century [^24]. In addition, there are several Middle Dutch works that allude to Van den vos Reynaerde. Jacob van Maerlant, for example, announces in his Rijmbijbel (completed in 1271) in connection with the truth value of his poem: dit nes niet madox droem / noch reinard noch arturs boerden (‘this is not Madoc’s dream, nor a wild story about Reinard or Artur’), perhaps referring to the story about Madoc mentioned in the first line of Van den vos Reynaerde.

However, the Flemish origin of the work is confirmed by the author’s use of place-names, such as ‘Abstale’ (802), ‘Belsele’ (2097), ‘Elmare’ (373 f .), ‘Hijf e’ (2262-63), ‘Hulsterloe’ (2575 f .), ‘Kriekepit’ (2578 f .), ‘Leye’ (2640) and ‘Waes’ (2257). These toponyms from the Ghent area indicate that the work’s primary audience must have been familiar with the geography of East Flanders (see also p. 28 and the  Index of proper names) [^26].\n\n[...]",

      "text": "Earlier we saw that Van den vos Reynaerde was probably written in the third quarter of the thirteenth century, for an audience and/or readership likely to have enjoyed the fact that the action is situated by the characters themselves in the Flemish landscape. For example, the convent where Reynaert is said to have acquired his pilgrim’s attributes and where Ysingrijn is said to have rung the bells is called Elmare (373, 1483, 1493), which was the name of a priory of Saint Peter’s Abbey near Ghent. Also, the wolf and the fox are said to have sworn an oath of allegiance under a tree near Belsele (2097), and Reynaert claims that the conspirators gathered between Hijfte and Ghent (2263). There can be no doubt, therefore, that the implied audience of Van den vos Reynaerde is East Flemish. However, the poem contains no information – not even in the prologue – that allows a more precise identification of the person(s) for whom it was intended. Scholars of necessity have to make the best of indirect and often ambiguous data. According to an old hypothesis Van den vos Reynaerde was written for a bourgeois audience. Its didactic tenor was thought to suit the mentality and cultural emancipation of the patricians in Flemish towns like Ghent and Bruges, which had enjoyed a marked economic boom in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and had also gained in political influence. In addition, it has been observed that this urban elite seems to be the only social group that is not satirized in Willem’s poem, whereas the aristocracy, clergy and country people are severely criticized and mocked. From this point of view Reynaert can be seen as a freedom-loving individualist whose quick-wittedness brings about the fall of the antiquated feudal system. King Nobel is considered as more or less mirroring the count of Flanders [^41].",

In their view Van den vos Reynaerde was written for a court audience, as has also been argued for the Old French Roman de Renart. In that case the story was not inspired by bourgeois resentment, but either by aristocratic self-mockery, or by a real concern for the decline of feudal society. The conflict of King Nobel with his vassal Reynaert might then mirror the tensions present among the Flemish aristocracy in the thirteenth century. The lower aristocracy had lost a sizeable part of its freedom and power in its dealings with the count. The count, moreover, was not only liege lord, he was also a vassal of the king of France. The two Flemish countesses, Johanna and her sister Margareta had to deal with liege lords (Philip Augustus, Louis VIII and IX) who aimed to limit the independence of their mighty vassal as much as lay within their power, making clever use of the conflicts between the count and the aristocracy and the urban patricians. There is some evidence that the aristocratic Dampierre family was familiar with Van den vos Reynaerde.",

It is not impossible, for example, that, as is suggested in lines 26-31 of the prologue, Van den vos Reynaerde had an aristocratic patron, but was listened to by a bourgeois audience. It should also be taken into account that the urban elite of the thirteenth century consisted of several layers, as the aristocracy by birth had mixed to a considerable degree with the more socially successful members of the bourgeoisie. The possibility that vernacular literature was aimed at different social communities as its intended audience has also been suggested. In that case the text will have appealed to both the bourgeois elite in the towns and the court aristocracy.",

      "text": "It is tempting to scan the text for details which might be made to fit the reality of the time and in particular the political situation in Flanders. In an extreme form we see this in attempts to read Van den vos Reynaerde as a roman à clef (see p. 16). Another approach is to detect connections with contemporary literature – which, of course, may also have implications for determining the primary audience of the beast narrative. In this context, it is striking that Van den vos Reynaerde pays far more detailed attention to the conflict between Reynaert and his liege lord Nobel than does the Old French Le Plaid. It is possible that the author plays here with a topical theme from contemporary chivalric romance. In Old French and Middle Dutch Charlemagne epics dating from the period 1170-1260, the antagonism between king and vassal is a major theme. The feudal order is maintained by powerful and loyal vassals like Guillaume d’Orange. However, in a number of texts internal tensions threaten the court community, because the king treats one of his loyal vassals unjustly. In a number of so-called ‘traitor epics’ the king is bribed or driven to do so by a malicious traitor who falsely accuses the loyal vassal of having devised a plot to murder the king, which he only just managed to foil, or so the traitor pretends. In the ‘epics of revolt’ (works like the Old French Renaut de Mon-tauban and the Middle Dutch adaptation of this text, Renout van Montalbaen) the king through his own malice causes the loyal vassals to rebel and to go into forced exile. Only at the end of the tale are king and vassal reconciled and traitors vanquished.",

      "text": "Then, too, the feudal order is restored with God’s help. Possibly well-known patterns from Charlemagne epics are reversed in Van den vos Reynaerde. The fox may then be seen as a (triumphant!) traitor who manages to persuade King Nobel to take his two loyal vassals, Bruun the bear and Ysingrijn the wolf, prisoner and to maltreat them by telling a brilliantly fabricated story of a conspiracy and of an equally imaginary treasure. Alternatively, Reynaert can be seen as a rebel vassal who is not reconciled with the king, but deliberately and successfully leaves the court community, preferring voluntary exile. \nThe implied audience of Van den vos Reynaerde must also have been familiar with a range of animal stories. In the prologue the author regrets that die avonture van Rey-naerde (4) had not yet been made in Dutch. It is only after several tens of lines that the tale appears to be about a fox, when it is said that all animals come to King Nobel’s court day, ‘except for Reynaert the fox alone’ (50). Between the appearance of Nobel die coninc (44) and the first reference to his status as a lion, there are more than 1800 lines: Voert sprac Reynaert: ‘Coninc lyoen ’ (1833) (‘Reynaert continued: “King Lion”’). \nWhen Ysingrijn is introduced, it is again not stated what kind of animal he is. The audience is informed of this only much later, when Reynaert confesses to his nephew Grimbeert his crimes against Ysingrijn among much else. On that occasion he mentions that it was his doing that the villagers noticed ‘that there was caught in the priest’s larder a wolf’ (1574-75). The author clearly did not think it necessary to mention the kind of animal concerned when he introduced these characters; he assumed that the audience would already be familiar with them from other stories. Where one passage from the fox’s confession is concerned, such foreknowledge can be demonstrated.[^44]",

In his Reynardus vulpes Balduinus extended the passage from his exemplar from four to sixteen Latin lines (663-78). However, the details of the interpolation were not of his own devising; too many narrative elements which are lacking in Van den vos Reynaerde are found in the version of the story from the Ysengrimus and branch III to make that likely. As Balduinus could not possibly know from the four Middle Dutch lines what Ysingrijn was fishing with, and why he could not escape (the wolf had followed the fox’s advice one night and had hung his tail in a hole in the ice which froze over during the night), he must have been familiar with another story about the wintry fishing expedition, from which he could derive material for his interpolation [^45].",

      "text": "Like Balduinus, the implied audience of Van den vos Reynaerde (assuming it was familiar with contemporary literature) also knew a version of ‘the fishing expedition on the ice’ as well as other beast narratives to which the text alludes. Willem’s poem refers in passing to various episodes which are lacking from its Old French source Le Plaid. These episodes must have been known in the thirteenth century as independent narratives. Some of these literary cross-currents may well have enhanced the appreciation of some characters’ manipulative speeches by those among the audience who were acquainted with these narratives.\nGrimbeert vigorously defends his absent uncle against the charges that have been brought against him. He blackens the reputation of Ysingrijn, Reynaert’s chief opponent, by dwelling on the cases when the wolf treated the fox badly. On one of those occasions the wolf is said to have taken advantage shamelessly of Reynaert’s courage. After the fox had thrown fish down from a cart to Ysingrijn, who was following at a safe distance, all Reynaert was offered as his share of the plunder by the greedy wolf were the bones of one single fish (206-16). This story of the fox and the cart loaded with fish is found outside Willem’s beast narrative in two branches of the Roman de Renart, dating from ca. 1178. The oldest version features as part of branch III. Renart shams dead when he sees a fish cart approaching. The merchants throw him on to the cart, with the intention of skinning the dead body at a later stage and selling the pelt. While the cart rattles along, Renart gorges himself on fish. Eventually the fox jumps down off the cart, with garlands of eels around his body, and taunts the merchants. A later version of his story is found in branch XIV ( La Queue – Primaut ), in which Renart tells the tale of his success in the fish cart to the wolf Primaut, one of Ysengrin’s brothers. Primaut then also lies down in the middle of the road shamming dead when a fish cart approaches, but this time the merchants are on their guard and give the wolf a merciless beating. Grimbeert’s story does not agree with the two Old French versions. One might assume that a story is referred to here which has been lost. However, another explanation is also worth considering. This particular fish cart version is Willem’s own invention, and a variation on well-known versions not unlike the story of the stolen ham which Grimbeert is going to produce next as an example of a deception practised by Ysingrijn (217-29). In the same way as the fox goes to great lengths to procure the ham for Ysingrijn and is rewarded on that occasion with the string that it hung from, Reynaert throws fish down from the cart to the wolf, who leaves just one single fish’ bones (214). The Middle Dutch author has Grimbeert twist the well-known versions of ‘the fox and the fish cart’ so that his uncle will be acquitted. That is the function of the link. Those among the audience who know the French versions will see through the procedure, and will reach the conclusion that Grimbeert is lying. Based on its prior knowledge of beast narratives the story’s public will have been able to estimate the extent to which characters in Van den vos Reynaerde reinterpret and twist older stories. That is an essential aspect of the retelling of events from branch II-Va by Ysingrijn, Grimbeert and Reynaert respectively. This oldest branch of the Roman de Renart, which was probably written around 1175, relates the beginning of the conflict between the fox and wolf. After a number of adventures that did not go well for the fox, Renart accidentally enters the den of the she-wolf Hersent, who has recently given birth to a number of cubs.\nRenart’s claim that her husband Ysengrin has been telling everyone that the fox is in love with her makes Hersent so angry that she turns the allegation into action and commits adultery. Ysengrin hears what has happened from the cubs, who have been befouled by the fox and called sons of a whore. The wolf is furious with his wife, who realizes that Renart has deceived her. When they hunt the fox, Hersent runs ahead in her eagerness, gets stuck in one of the entrances to the fox’s den, and is subsequently raped by Renart, an action witnessed from a distance by her husband who arrives a little later. Ysengrin charges the fox at King Noble’s court with rape, keeping quiet in the meantime about the earlier adultery. However, the fox is not sentenced, but it is decided that Renart is to swear his innocence on the bones of a saint. Ysengrin decides to take the law into his own hands, and devises an ambush. On the appointed day Renart is to swear on the teeth of the mastiff Roonel, who is told to feign death. Then, as soon as he has gripped the fox with his jaws, a pack of dogs will pounce on the fox. However, the fox notices the deception and manages to escape just in time. If the audience of Van den vos Reynaerde is familiar with the events in these branches, it will understand why the wolf, in making his complaint, not only remains silent about the adultery between the she-wolf and the fox, but deliberately mentions the rape of Hersint and the maltreatment of the cubs in one breath, suggesting in so do-ing that the two crimes took place in the wolf ’s lair (thus obviating the need to ex-plain that Hersint was raped in the fox’s den, which, from a legal point of view, would be suspicious). The listener sees through Ysingrijn’s pretence at astonishment when he states that Reynaert was to swear his innocence with an oath and continues: ‘as the relics were brought, he changed his mind, and escaped us in his stronghold’ (83-85). After all, it was not Reynaert’s wily character, but the ambush with Roonel and the other mastiffs that made the fox decide to run for it. The audience, armed as it is with its knowledge of other stories, also understands that Grimbeert ignores the rape and stresses the adultery, which he re-interprets as proof of a courtly love affair of more than seven years standing between Reynaert and Haersint (234-46). Reynaert, too, alludes in his confession and at court to the adulterous relationship (1648-69, 1970-92), which makes sense only if it is assumed that the audience already knew the popular story about it.",

      "text": "How do these literary cross-currents affect our ideas about the primary audience of Van den vos Reynaerde? As the beast narratives that Willem takes to be common knowledge are not extant in Middle Dutch, but only in Old French, a bilingual audience must be assumed in Flanders. The fact that it knows that Nobel die coninc is a lion, shows familiarity with the Old French literary tradition in which King Lion is called Noble for the first time (see branche II-Va). The fact that in Willem’s poem the small dog Cortoys ‘complained to the king in French’ (100), a complaint that is clearly understood perfectly by the courtiers, as Tybeert’s and Grimbeert’s reactions show, is also indicative of familiarity with bilingualism among the primary listeners of Van den vos Reynaerde. This also furthers our understanding of the reason why Willem did not limit himself to making a translation when he turned Le Plaid into Dutch (see also the prologue, line 4 ff .), but instead wrote a reworked narrative with a brilliant ending in literary competition with his French colleagues. After the fox’s conviction the Old French author concludes his story using about two hundred lines. However, from this point onwards, Willem adds another 1500 lines or so, almost doubling the poem in size, focusing on Reynaert’s escape from his sentence by means of an elaborate and ingenious collection of lies. A bilingual audience will no doubt have enjoyed the competitive spirit (see p. 13). This seems an additional argument to regard the patricians of Ghent as the implied audience, as the Flemish-speaking urban elite learned French in childhood to facilitate contacts in adult life with commercial partners and the high aristocracy.",

The codices are known among scholars by the names of the places where they used to be kept: the Comburg manuscript and the Dyck manuscript. In addition fragments of three other manuscripts have been found. When after several centuries the codices had lost their original function, bookbinders used strips or leaves from these volumes in the bindings of printed books, from which they were retrieved in later centuries. Reynaert scholars refer to these fragments as the Darmstadt, Rotterdam and Brussels fragments, according to the cities where they are kept. The five sources are frequently referred to simply by the letters A, F, E, G and J. The first manuscript (A) was discovered at the end of the eighteenth century in the library of the Ritterstift Comburg near Schwäbisch Hall in Baden-Württemberg (now Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Cod. poet. et phil. 2° 22). It is a composite manuscript, assembled around 1540, that consists of six parts, all of which were produced in East Flanders (probably in Ghent) within a span of forty years (ca. 1380-1420) by ten different scribes. The volume numbers 346 parchment folios (267x195 mm) and contains some fifty different texts, among them Die Rose by a certain Heinric, poems by Jacob van Maerlant, Van Sente Brandane, sections from Jan van Boendale’s Der leken spieghel , and the Rijmkroniek van Vlaanderen. \nThe beast epic Van den vos Reynaerde, in total 3469 lines – on folios 192vºa – 213rºb – is part of the fourth manuscript, numbering 56 folios (179-234). It was copied at the beginning of the fifteenth century by scribe E with two columns of 42 lines per page in a Textualis, the usual formal bookscript [^46]. The present edition is based on the text in this manuscript [^47].\nThe second complete manuscript (F) was not discovered until a century later, in 1907, again in a German aristocratic library, this time of Schloss Dyck near Neuss in Rheinland-Westfalen. The manuscript numbers 124 parchment folios (294/6x211 mm), written in two columns of 40 lines per page in a Textualis. It was probably produced in the period 1330-1360 in Nedersticht or the eastern part of the county of Holland. Van den vos Reynaerde numbers 3393 lines, covering folios 102rºb-123rºb, following Jacob van Maerlant’s encyclopedia Der naturen bloeme.

Balduinus begins as follows: Fabula Reynardi, sicut reor agnita mul-tis teutonice scripta, metrificata sonet (‘may the history of Reynaert, known as I think to many in Dutch, now sound in Latin verse’). The poem was written between 1272-1279, but has been preserved only in a rather corrupt printed edition, produced in the workshop of Ketelaer and De Leempt in 1473 or 1474 in Utrecht, which is extant in two copies: Deventer, Stads- or Atheneumbibliotheek, Inc. VIII C 8 (4) and Mainz, Priesterseminar, Ms. 165 (8). \nBalduinus integrally adopted the narrative structure of Van den vos Reynaerde and often stayed close to the Flemish text with his choice of words. However, he definitely also added emphases that are entirely his own, mainly by means of abbreviations and moralisations, and placed himself in the Latin literary tradition. The Reynardus vulpes was – and still is – used mainly by literary historians as an early source (L) of Van den vos Reynaerde [^53].",

      "text": "Reynaerts historie, a poem of some 7800 lines, was written at least a century and a half later. In its first part the unknown Flemish poet follows Van den vos Reynaerde fairly accurately. However, in his version the fox does not flee into the wilderness, but stays at Mapertuus, while King Nobel extends the court day because of his reconciliation with Bruun and Ysegrim. A sequel of about 4300 lines has been added here, in which more charges are brought against Reynaert. At Nobel’s court the fox defends himself against the accusations with the help of his clan. The trial ends in a judicial duel between Reynaert and Ysegrim, which the fox manages to decide in his favour. King Nobel next presents him with a high position in his realm. The text has been preserved in two manuscripts. The ‘Brussels’ manuscript (B), acquired in 1836 by the Koninklijke Bibli-otheek in Brussels, where it is kept under shelfmark 14601, was produced around 1470 in the northern Low Countries, possibly in Utrecht, by a scribe who, according to two acrostics (in B 7805-7794) is called Claes van Aken [^54]. The fragments (C), formerly in the possession of Hendrik van Wijn, were acquired by the Koninklijke Bibliotheek of The Hague in 1834, and are now kept under shelfmark 75 B 7. According to the colo-phon, these ‘the Hague’ fragments are the remnants of a manuscript that was produced in Holland in 1477. The text numbers 1055 lines, corresponding to B 6755-7793. [^55] Reynaerts historie was long studied primarily as a ‘textual link’: on the one hand as an adaptation and, consequently, a source of Van den vos Reynaerde, on the other hand as an exemplar of the printed editions by Leeu, Caxton and others (see below). Only in the past few decades has literary appreciation of the text begun. The verse text of Reynaerts historie was printed (probably unchanged) between 1487 and 1490 by Gheraert Leeu in Antwerp, illustrated with woodcuts, divided into chapters by Hinrek van Alckmer, and provided with summarizing chapter headings and prose moralisations [^56]. Only seven leaves of this verse incunabulum (D) have survived (including four woodcuts), which are now kept in the University Library of Cam-bridge under shelfmark Inc. 4 F 6.2 (3367). The text corresponds to lines B 1513-88, 1639-55, 1753-72, 1780-890 [^57]. Hinrek van Alckmer’s name occurs in the prologue to a Lower German adaptation of the verse incunabulum, Reynke de vos (R). The only complete copy of this edition, printed in Lübeck in 1498, which also has woodcuts, chapter headings and prose moralisations, is kept in the Herzog August-Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel (shelfmark 32. / 4 Poet. rar.) [^58]. It should be noted that the text of Reynke de vos does not derive directly from D, but from a now lost Dutch printed edition. As Reynke de vos, the poem made a triumphant conquest of Europe, now documented in great detail by Hubertus Menke in his international Reynaert bibliography [^59]. The Low German text was reprinted up to 1660, translated into High German in 1544 and into Danish in 1555. Publications in Swedish and Icelandic were based on the Danish edition, while the High German translation was reprinted no fewer than twenty-one times up to 1617. It spawned a number of subgroups, among them a set of seven Latin printed texts (1567-1612). On the basis of Gottsched’s High German prose translation of Reynke de vos from 1752, Goethe composed his famous adaptation in hexameters: Reineke Fuchs, In zwölf Gesängen (1794). This poem established a tradition of its own, with translations into many languages. A Middle Dutch prose adaptation of Reynaerts historie had already been printed by Gheraert Leeu in Gouda in 1479 and by Jacob Jacobsz. van der Meer in Delft in 1485 as Die historie van Reynaert die vos (Pg, Pd). Two copies are extant of the text that was printed in Gouda: The Hague, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Inc. 169 G 98, and Lon-don, British Library, Inc. Grenville 10495. Of the book printed in Delft a single copy is extant: San Marino, Huntington Library, 100244 (PR 8873-5) [^60]. Two years after Leeu, William Caxton printed The history of reynaerd the fox (1481) in Westminster, trans-lated by himself from a ‘copye whiche was in dutche’ (W); this is the beginning of an English Reynaert tradition that encompasses three centuries. It is likely that Pg was not the first printed prose Reynaert , as neither Pd nor W appear to derive directly from Pg. The prose editions share a division into chapters with summarizing headings, but lack the moralisations and the woodcuts that grace the rhymed version [^61].",

      "text": "The so-called Reynaert chapbooks produced in the Low Countries can be divided into three groups [^62] These are the sixteenth-century luxury publications by Plantijn (H1564, H1566), the chapbooks from the northern parts of the Low Countries (Hn: 16 th -18 th century) and those from the southern Low Countries (Hz: 17 th - 20 th century) [^63].\nVarious printed editions must have been lost; some are known only because they are referred to somewhere, or are hypothetical. Each of the three groups is in its own way based on a reconstructed printed edition (H), for which material is believed to have been derived from the tradition of both D (prologue and illustrations) and P (prose text) [^64]. The adaptation techniques used in the chapbooks – abbreviation, simplification, moralisation, alteration of offensive passages (a frequent phenomenon in printed texts in the Southern Low Countries which were subject to ecclesiastical censure) – have proved rewarding objects of research [^65].\nThe rediscovery at the beginning of the nineteenth century of the medieval manuscripts containing Van den vos Reynaerde in combination with the fascination with the past that Romanticism had aroused, created an immense interest in the Reynaert material. In the newly formed state of Belgium (dominated by a French-speaking elite) this interest was further strengthened by the ‘flamingants’, a Flemish emancipatory move-ment that drew upon the cultural achievements of their medieval ancestors to demand equal rights. Editions of the Middle Dutch texts, as well as a large number of modern adaptations for the entertainment of both adult and young readers were the result [^66] In Dutch literary histories, Van den vos Reynaerde now takes pride of place.",
