Title: Textual Problems in the Commedia: Manuscript Evidence and Editorial Practice
Authors: Rossi, Maria
Date: 2015
Entities:
- Divina Commedia (work)
- Dante Alighieri (person)
- Giovanni Boccaccio (person)
- Odyssey (work)
- Florence (place)
- 1308-1321 (date)
- Christian theology (concept)

Title: The Authorship Problem of On the Sublime: Prosopographical Evidence and Dating
Authors: Johnson, Robert
Date: 2012
Entities:
- On the Sublime (work)
- Longinus (attributed) (person)
- Cassius Longinus (person)
- Rome (place)
- Syria (place)
- 1st century CE (date)
- death circa 273 CE (date)
- rhetorical theory (concept)
- literary aesthetics (concept)
- rhetorician (role)
- philosopher (role)
Context:
Johnson (2012) examines the long-standing authorship problem of On the Sublime, traditionally attributed to 'Longinus'. The study employs prosopographical methods to evaluate two main candidates: an unknown 1st-century rhetorician and Cassius Longinus (died 273 CE), a 3rd-century philosopher and rhetorician. The work discusses rhetorical theory and literary aesthetics. Johnson argues for 1st-century composition based on stylistic analysis and historical references within the text, rejecting the later attribution to Cassius Longinus despite the traditional manuscript attribution.

TASK: Create a Knowledge Graph about what [{'family_name': 'Wackers', 'given_name': 'Paul'}] argue(s) or express(es) in their work "Wat staat er eigenlijk? Over het editeren van Van den vos Reynaerde". Combine the given entities (nodes) with relations based on the source questions and answers below.

SOURCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
Q1: In Wat staat er eigenlijk? Over het editeren van Van den vos Reynaerde, the subject of inquiry is the Van den vos Reynaerde. Does the author talk about the authorship attribution? What is the main point of the authors? What are the entities that take part in his discourse?
A1: In "Wat staat er eigenlijk? Over het editeren van Van den vos Reynaerde," Paul Wackers discusses the editing and textual transmission of "Van den vos Reynaerde," but he does not explicitly address authorship attribution concerning the author Willem. He highlights discrepancies in the acrostic that identifies the author, noting that while Wikipedia states it as "biwilleme," the manuscript reads "biwbdleme" [^2]. Wackers emphasizes that modern editions often manipulate the original text for clarity, which may mislead readers about the authenticity of the manuscript's representation [^2]. The main point of Wackers' discourse is to raise awareness about the editorial practices applied to the text and the implications of these interventions on the understanding of the manuscript's authenticity [^2]. The entities involved in his analysis include the original author Willem, the editors of various editions, and the manuscripts themselves, such as the Comburg and Dyck handschriften, which serve as critical sources for understanding the text's evolution [^4][^5]. However, the context does not provide detailed information about the specific authorship claims or the broader implications of these editorial decisions on the attribution of the work.

Q2: What does Paul Wackers say about the 'acrostic problem', and how does he shape his interpretation of the authorship? What do they say about the context of the creation of the poem?
A2: Paul Wackers addresses the 'acrostic problem' in "Wat staat er eigenlijk? Over het editeren van Van den vos Reynaerde" by highlighting discrepancies between the acrostic identifying the author as "biwilleme" in Wikipedia and the actual manuscript reading "biwbdleme" [^3]. He emphasizes that modern editions often manipulate the original text, which can mislead readers regarding the authenticity of the manuscript's representation [^3]. Wackers argues that while the editors' interventions may be justified for clarity, they do not reflect the original text accurately, thereby complicating the understanding of authorship attribution. He notes that the desire to present an 'original' version sometimes overrides respect for the transmitted manuscripts, suggesting that editorial practices can obscure the historical context of the poem's creation [^1]. However, Wackers does not provide detailed information about the broader implications of these editorial decisions on the authorship claims or the specific context of the poem's creation beyond the acrostic issue.

Q3: How does Paul Wackers substantiate his claims? What proofs does he provide? Which techniques does he use? What degree of certainty does he have?
A3: Paul Wackers substantiates his claims in "Wat staat er eigenlijk? Over het editeren van Van den vos Reynaerde" through a detailed examination of the editorial practices applied to the text, particularly focusing on the acrostic problem and the discrepancies in author identification. He highlights that while Wikipedia states the acrostic reads "biwilleme," the manuscript actually shows "biwbdleme," indicating a significant editorial alteration [^3]. Wackers employs techniques such as textual analysis and comparison of manuscript readings to demonstrate how modern editions manipulate the original text for clarity, which may mislead readers about authenticity [^3]. He discusses the complexities of diplomatic editing, emphasizing that the aim is to enhance readability while preserving the original text's integrity [^4]. Wackers expresses a degree of certainty regarding the implications of these editorial decisions, arguing that they obscure the historical context of the poem's creation and complicate authorship attribution, although he does not provide specific quantitative measures or external corroborating documents to support his assertions [^1]. Overall, while he presents a compelling critique of editorial practices, the context does not fully detail the broader implications of these practices on authorship claims or the specific historical context of the poem's creation.

   - "authorial_argument": What the author actively argues, proposes, or claims (e.g., "Daele argues Willem van Boudelo created the work", "Peeters claims it was written in Land of Waas")

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- If the text presents something as established historical fact → established_fact
- If the text presents the author's interpretation, hypothesis, or argument → authorial_argument
- Biographical facts (birth, death dates) when uncontested → established_fact
- Authorship attributions that are argued/proposed → authorial_argument

4. For relation properties, include contextual information:
   - "asserted_by": Who makes this claim (use author name from document metadata, or "unknown_source" for established facts without specific attribution)
